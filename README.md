## What Is This?

OpenProphet is a fully autonomous trading harness that runs an AI agent on a heartbeat loop. The agent wakes up on a schedule, assesses market conditions, manages positions, and executes trades — all without human intervention. A mobile-friendly web dashboard at `http://localhost:3737` streams everything in real time.

```

### The Loop

1. Agent wakes up on heartbeat (interval varies by market phase)
2. OpenCode subprocess spawns with Claude model + MCP tools
3. Agent calls tools: check account, scan news, analyze setups, place orders
4. Results stream to the web dashboard via SSE
5. Agent sleeps until next heartbeat

The agent controls its own heartbeat interval via the `set_heartbeat` MCP tool — it can speed up during volatile periods or slow down when markets are calm.

## Features

### Automated Analysis Scheduler
- **Pre-market briefing** — Runs automatically at 6:00 AM ET on weekdays. Calls `run_market_briefing`, `run_ftd_check`, `run_economic_calendar`, and `run_earnings_calendar`, then saves `data/reports/daily_brief_YYYYMMDD.json`
- **Weekly screeners** — Runs automatically at 6:00 PM ET on Sundays. Calls `run_market_briefing`, `run_market_top_check`, `run_vcp_screener`, and `run_pead_screener`, then saves `data/reports/weekly_regime_YYYYMMDD.json`
- **Prophet auto-reads results** — On each pre-market heartbeat Prophet calls `read_latest_report("daily_brief")` before making any trading decisions. On Mondays it also reads `read_latest_report("weekly_regime")` for the Sunday watchlist
- **Manual trigger** — `POST /api/scheduler/trigger` lets you run either job on demand (see Dashboard API)
- **SSE streaming** — Job start/end events stream to the dashboard terminal in real time

### Autonomous Agent
- **Phased heartbeat** — Pre-market (15m), market open (2m), midday (10m), close (2m), after hours (30m), closed (1h)
- **Session persistence** — OpenCode `--session` flag maintains context across beats
- **System prompt optimization** — Only sent on first beat, saving ~2,000 tokens/beat
- **User interrupts** — Send messages mid-beat; kills current subprocess, resumes on same session
- **Agent self-modification** — Tools to update its own prompt, strategy rules, permissions, and heartbeat

### Web Dashboard
- **Paper aesthetic** — Crimson Pro headings, Source Sans 3 body, IBM Plex Mono for data, warm `#faf9f6` background with SVG fractal noise texture
- **8 tabs** — Terminal, Trades, Portfolio, Agents, Strategies, Accounts, Plugins, Settings
- **Real-time SSE streaming** — Agent text, tool calls, tool results, beat lifecycle, trade events
- **Terminal search/filter** — Search logs by text, filter by level (text, tools, errors, beats)
- **Chat input** — Send messages to the agent, interrupt running beats
- **Mobile-first** — Responsive layout, touch-friendly, tab-based navigation
- **Tab visibility optimization** — Pauses SSE and polling when tab is hidden

### Security & Guardrails
- **Token-based auth** — Set `AGENT_AUTH_TOKEN` env var to require Bearer token on all API routes
- **Secret stripping** — `safeConfig()` masks secret keys in all SSE broadcasts and API responses
- **MCP permission enforcement** — `enforcePermissions()` checks before every tool execution:
  - `blockedTools` — Reject calls to specific tools
  - `allowLiveTrading` — Block all order tools when disabled
  - `allowOptions` / `allowStocks` — Asset class gates
  - `allow0DTE` — Parses OCC option symbols to check expiration date
  - `maxOrderValue` — Rejects orders exceeding dollar limit
  - `requireConfirmation` — Blocks orders with descriptive error
- **Daily loss circuit breaker** — Auto-pauses agent when P&L exceeds `maxDailyLoss`%
- **Max tool rounds per beat** — Passed as `--max-turns` to OpenCode CLI
- **Path traversal protection** — `get_news_summary` sanitizes filenames

### Multi-Account
- **Multiple Alpaca accounts** — Add paper/live accounts via dashboard
- **Hot-swap** — Activating a different account kills the Go backend and restarts with new credentials
- **Go backend auto-restart** — 5-second delay restart on unexpected crashes

### Plugins
- **Slack notifications** — Trade executed, agent start/stop, errors, position opened/closed, daily summary, heartbeat
- **Daily summary** — Scheduled at 4:30 PM ET with P&L, portfolio value, and beat/trade/error counts

### AI Intelligence
- **Gemini news cleaning** — Transforms noisy RSS feeds into structured trading intelligence
- **Multi-source aggregation** — Google News, MarketWatch (top stories, real-time, bulletins, market pulse)
- **Technical analysis** — RSI, MACD, momentum indicators via Go backend
- **Vector similarity search** — Semantic search over past trades using local embeddings (384-dim, sqlite-vec)

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.22+** — For the trading backend
- **Node.js 18+** — For the agent server and MCP tools
- **[OpenCode CLI](https://opencode.ai)** — The AI harness that drives the autonomous agent
- **Alpaca account** — [alpaca.markets](https://alpaca.markets) (paper trading is free)

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeverLucky2/ClaudeProphetAndFriends
cd ClaudeProphetAndFriends
npm install
go build -o prophet_bot.exe ./cmd/bot
cp opencode.example.jsonc opencode.jsonc
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:
```bash
# Required
ALPACA_PUBLIC_KEY=your_alpaca_public_key
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret_key
ALPACA_ENDPOINT=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets

# Optional
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key        # AI news cleaning
AGENT_AUTH_TOKEN=your_secret_token    # Protect dashboard API
AGENT_PORT=3737                       # Dashboard port
FMP_API_KEY=your_fmp_key              # Analysis scheduler + screener skills (free tier: 250 calls/day)
```

### 3. Install and Authenticate OpenCode

OpenProphet uses [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) as its AI runtime. OpenCode is an open-source CLI that connects to Claude (and other models) with full MCP tool support. The agent harness spawns `opencode run` as a subprocess on each heartbeat.

```bash
# Install OpenCode globally
npm install -g opencode

# Authenticate with Anthropic (opens browser for OAuth)
opencode auth login
```

After login, verify it worked:

```bash
opencode auth list
# Should show "Anthropic" with "oauth" credential
```

#### OpenCode Configuration

OpenProphet requires an `opencode.jsonc` file in the project root to register the MCP trading tools. This file is **not included in the repo** (it's gitignored) since it may contain personal MCP servers or API keys. Create your own from the provided example:

```bash
cp opencode.example.jsonc opencode.jsonc
```

The example config registers the Prophet MCP tools server, which is all you need:

```jsonc
// opencode.jsonc
{
  "mcp": {
    "prophet": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["node", "./mcp-server.js"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

You can add any additional MCP servers you use (Playwright, Cartogopher, etc.) to your local `opencode.jsonc` -- it won't be committed.

#### How the Agent Uses OpenCode

Each heartbeat, the harness spawns:

```bash
opencode run \
  --format json \
  --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --max-turns 25 \
  --session <session-id>
```

- `--format json` — Streams structured events (text, tool_use, step_finish) that the dashboard parses
- `--model` — Set from the dashboard Settings tab (any Anthropic model)
- `--max-turns` — Maps to `maxToolRoundsPerBeat` in permissions config
- `--session` — Continues the same conversation across beats, preserving context

The system prompt is piped via stdin (too large for CLI args). On the first beat it includes the full system prompt + trading rules. Subsequent beats on the same session skip the system prompt to save ~2,000 tokens/beat.

#### Using OpenCode Interactively (Optional)

You can also use OpenCode directly for manual trading with the same MCP tools:

```bash
# Start the Go backend first
.\prophet_bot.exe

# Then run OpenCode interactively with the trading tools
opencode
```

OpenCode will pick up the `opencode.jsonc` config and give you access to all 45+ trading tools in an interactive chat session. This is useful for manual trading sessions or testing tools before enabling the autonomous agent.

### 4. Start the Dashboard

```bash
npm run agent
```

This starts the Express server on port 3737, which automatically launches the Go backend. Open `http://localhost:3737` (or your network IP) and press **Start**.

You can also authenticate OpenCode from the dashboard's **Settings** tab if you haven't done it from the CLI.

### 5. (Alternative) MCP-Only Mode

If you just want the MCP tools without the autonomous agent — for use with Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client:

```bash
# Start Go backend
.\prophet_bot.exe

# Option A: Use with OpenCode interactively
opencode

# Option B: Configure in Claude Code's .mcp.json
# Option C: Point any MCP client at: node /path/to/mcp-server.js
```

The MCP server is a standalone stdio server that works with any MCP-compatible client. It connects to the Go backend on port 4534.

## Strategy Improvement Loop

Prophet logs every decision — buy, sell, hold — to `data/sandboxes/<id>/decisive_actions/` with full reasoning. Four Claude Code skills in `.claude/skills/` close the feedback loop, turning those logs into updated strategy rules.

Open a Claude Code session in this project directory and type the slash command to run any skill.

### Daily — `/agent-health`

**Run:** Every trading day. Also run any time the agent behaves unexpectedly.

Confirms the correct strategy is loaded, scans the last 24 hours of decisions for rule violations, and checks whether loss-review thresholds (3.5% / 5% intraday drawdown) were triggered and honored. Returns a single-line `HEALTHY / WATCH / ALERT` status with a reason.

```
/agent-health
```

---

### Daily (pre-market) — `/scenario-analysis`

**Run:** Every trading day before the open. Also run before any macro-driven position entry over $20K, or any time a major macro event (FOMC decision, tariff announcement, inflation data, geopolitical shock) could shift the thesis on an existing position.

Scans today's top financial headlines, selects the most macro-significant story, and runs a two-phase analysis pipeline. The **Scenario Analyst** builds 18-month Base/Bull/Bear scenarios with 1st/2nd/3rd-order sector impacts and 3–5 positive and negative US stock picks. The **Strategy Reviewer** then independently critiques the output for coverage gaps, probability errors, bias, and missing alternative scenarios. Both reports are saved to `data/reports/`.

```
/scenario-analysis                                    # auto — finds today's top macro headline
/scenario-analysis "Fed signals no cuts until 2027"   # manual — provide a specific headline
/scenario-analysis tariffs China semiconductors       # manual — provide a topic
```

---

### Weekly — `/review-performance`

**Run:** Every Monday pre-market. Also run after any stretch of 3+ consecutive losing trades.

Reads the last 5 activity logs and 40 decisive actions. Computes win rate, profit factor, largest win/loss, and rule violation count. Surfaces behavioral patterns — hesitation, revenge trading, thesis drift. Ends with specific recommended rule changes. Does **not** apply them; use `/adapt-strategy` for that.

```
/review-performance
```

---

### After Any Notable Loss — `/postmortem [symbol or date]`

**Run:** Immediately after a significant losing trade, a winner that reverses into a loss, or any time the same mistake seems to be repeating.

Reconstructs the full trade timeline, identifies the single root cause (bad entry, stop discipline failure, no partial exit, etc.), and writes the exact rule text that would have prevented it. Also scans history to check whether the same mistake has appeared before.

```
/postmortem QQQ              # deep-dive on a specific symbol
/postmortem 2026-04-23       # deep-dive on a specific session
/postmortem                  # auto-selects most recent losing trade
```

---

### Weekly or After Any Bad Stretch — `/adapt-strategy`

**Run:** After `/review-performance` surfaces patterns, or after `/postmortem` identifies a recurring mistake. Also run after any 3+ consecutive losing days.

Compares the last 30 days of actual decisions against the current `Aggressive Options v2` rules, proposes specific edits with quoted evidence from the decision log, and applies the ones you approve. Changes are written to `data/agent-config.json` and take effect on Prophet's **next heartbeat** — no restart needed.

```
/adapt-strategy
```

---

### Recommended Schedule

| Frequency | Skill | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Daily (pre-market) | `/scenario-analysis` | Every trading day before open; before any macro-driven entry >$20K |
| Daily | `/agent-health` | Every trading day |
| Weekly | `/review-performance` | Every Monday pre-market |
| On demand | `/postmortem [symbol]` | After any significant loss |
| Weekly / on demand | `/adapt-strategy` | After review or 3+ losing days |

The full weekly cycle:

```
Daily pre-market:    /scenario-analysis     ← macro briefing; auto-finds today's headline
                     /agent-health          ← operational status check

Monday pre-market:   /review-performance
                     /adapt-strategy        ← apply approved findings

Any loss:            /postmortem [symbol]
                     /adapt-strategy        ← apply if pattern is confirmed

Before any macro     /scenario-analysis "headline or topic"
trade >$20K:
```

Each `/adapt-strategy` run produces rules that reflect what the agent actually did — not aspirational guidelines written in a vacuum. Over time the gap between stated rules and actual behavior narrows, and the strategy compounds on itself.

## Automated Analysis Scheduler

The scheduler runs two recurring jobs automatically whenever the server is running — no manual invocation needed. Results are saved to `data/reports/` and Prophet reads them automatically at the start of each pre-market heartbeat.

### Jobs

| Job | Trigger | Output | Notes |
|-----|---------|--------|-------|
| `daily_briefing` | 6:00 AM ET weekdays · startup if file missing | `data/reports/daily_brief_YYYYMMDD.json` | FMP optional |
| `weekly_screeners` | 6:00 PM ET Sundays | `data/reports/weekly_regime_YYYYMMDD.json` | FMP required for screeners |
| `scenario_analysis` | Startup if no `scenario_*_YYYYMMDD.md` today | `data/reports/scenario_*.md` + `review_*.md` | Web search required |
| `review_performance` | 6:05 AM ET Mondays · startup if not run this week | Terminal output only | Reads last 5 sessions + 40 decisions |
| `postmortem` | 4:30 PM ET if session P&L ≤ −5% · startup if yesterday was ≤ −5% | Terminal output only | Passes loss date as argument |
| `adapt_strategy` | After `review_performance` or `postmortem` · after 3 consecutive losing days | Edits `data/agent-config.json` | Auto-applies all proposed rule changes |

**State persistence:** `review_performance`, `postmortem`, and `adapt_strategy` don't produce output files, so the scheduler tracks whether they've already run in `data/scheduler-state.json`. This survives server restarts — if you ran the weekly review and then restart the server, it won't re-run until next week.

**Significant loss threshold:** A session P&L of −5% or worse triggers `postmortem`. This matches the agent's own stop-trading threshold — if the agent halted trading for the day, the session is worth analyzing. Sessions with zero trades are ignored.

### Daily briefing JSON structure

```json
{
  "date": "2026-04-23",
  "generated_at": "2026-04-23T10:00:00Z",
  "market_posture": "BULLISH",
  "breadth_score": 74,
  "uptrend_ratio": 68.5,
  "ftd_status": "active_ftd",
  "tier1_macro_events": [{ "date": "2026-04-29", "event": "FOMC Decision", "impact": "high" }],
  "key_earnings_this_week": [{ "date": "2026-04-24", "ticker": "META", "timing": "after_close" }],
  "exposure_ceiling_pct": 100,
  "summary": "Market breadth is improving with 74/100 composite score..."
}
```

`market_posture` bands: **BULLISH** (breadth ≥ 70) / **NEUTRAL** (40–69) / **BEARISH** (< 40). `exposure_ceiling_pct` is automatically reduced when `ftd_status` is `correction` or a tier-1 macro event falls today.

### Weekly regime JSON structure

```json
{
  "date": "2026-04-20",
  "generated_at": "2026-04-20T22:00:00Z",
  "breadth_score": 71,
  "uptrend_ratio": 65.2,
  "market_top_score": 32,
  "distribution_days": 2,
  "market_posture": "BULLISH",
  "vcp_candidates": [
    { "ticker": "NVDA", "score": 88, "execution_state": "Pre-breakout", "pivot_price": 875.0, "stop_loss": 840.0 }
  ],
  "pead_candidates": [
    { "ticker": "AXON", "score": 79, "entry_zone": "265-270", "stop_loss": 258.0 }
  ],
  "weekly_thesis": "Breadth expanding with low distribution. Favor momentum longs..."
}
```

`market_posture` options: **BULLISH** / **NEUTRAL** / **BEARISH** / **CORRECTION** / **TOP_RISK**. Up to 5 candidates each, sorted by score descending.

### How Prophet uses the reports

On every pre-market heartbeat Prophet calls `read_latest_report("daily_brief")` first. On Mondays it additionally calls `read_latest_report("weekly_regime")`. The reports inform:

- Whether to enter new positions (`exposure_ceiling_pct`)
- Which watchlist candidates to prioritize (`vcp_candidates`, `pead_candidates`)
- Whether a macro event today warrants reducing size
- Whether an FTD is active (supports adding exposure) or a correction is in progress (supports cutting exposure)

### Triggering jobs manually

Use the REST API to run any job immediately without waiting for the schedule:

```bash
# Pre-market briefing
curl -X POST http://localhost:3737/api/scheduler/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"job": "daily_briefing"}'

# Weekly screeners
curl -X POST http://localhost:3737/api/scheduler/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"job": "weekly_screeners"}'

# Scenario analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:3737/api/scheduler/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"job": "scenario_analysis"}'

# Weekly performance review
curl -X POST http://localhost:3737/api/scheduler/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"job": "review_performance"}'

# Postmortem for a specific date or symbol
curl -X POST http://localhost:3737/api/scheduler/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"job": "postmortem", "date": "2026-04-22"}'

# Adapt strategy (auto-applies all proposed rule changes)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3737/api/scheduler/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"job": "adapt_strategy"}'
```

If `AGENT_AUTH_TOKEN` is set, add `-H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"` to the request.

Only one job runs at a time. If a job is already running, the API returns `400 { "error": "Job already running: <name>" }`.

### Checking scheduler status

The scheduler status is included in the health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3737/api/health
```

```json
{
  "scheduler": {
    "running": true,
    "activeJob": null,
    "lastDailyBriefDate": "2026-04-23",
    "lastWeeklyScreenDate": "2026-04-20",
    "lastScenarioDate": "2026-04-23",
    "lastReviewWeek": "2026-W17",
    "lastPostmortemDate": "2026-04-22",
    "lastAdaptDate": "2026-04-22"
  }
}
```

## Development

### Adding a New MCP Tool

1. Add the endpoint in Go (`controllers/` + route in `cmd/bot/main.go`)
2. Add the tool definition in `mcp-server.js` (name, description, input schema)
3. Add the handler in the `switch` block in `mcp-server.js`
4. If it's an order tool, add permission checks in `enforcePermissions()`

### Project Scripts

```bash
npm run agent    # Start dashboard + agent server (port 3737)
npm start        # Start MCP server only (for Claude Code integration)
```

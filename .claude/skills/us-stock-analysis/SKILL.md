# US Stock Analysis

## Overview

Perform comprehensive analysis of US stocks covering fundamental analysis (financials, business quality, valuation), technical analysis (indicators, trends, patterns), peer comparisons, and generate detailed investment reports. Apply structured analytical frameworks over high-quality data — FMP API when available (preferred), WebSearch as fallback.

## Data Sources

**Preferred: FMP scripts (when `FMP_API_KEY` is set).** These return structured, consistent, single-source data and replace the bulk of web searching. Always try these first — they're faster, more reliable, and produce comparable numbers across timestamps.

| Need | Script | Example |
|---|---|---|
| All fundamentals + analyst data + news for ONE ticker | `scripts/fetch_stock_snapshot.py` | `python scripts/fetch_stock_snapshot.py --ticker SE` |
| Real technicals (MA20/50/200, RSI, MACD, ATR, 52w range) | `scripts/fetch_technicals.py` | `python scripts/fetch_technicals.py --ticker SE` |
| Side-by-side peer multiples table | `scripts/fetch_peers.py` | `python scripts/fetch_peers.py --tickers SE,MELI,PDD,GRAB` |

Run from the skill directory. Each script emits a single JSON object on stdout — pipe to a file or capture inline. If `FMP_API_KEY` is not set, the script exits 1 with a clear message; fall back to WebSearch.

**Recommended workflow for a comprehensive report:**
1. Run `fetch_stock_snapshot.py --ticker <T>` → fundamentals + analyst data
2. Run `fetch_technicals.py --ticker <T>` → real chart indicators
3. Identify 3–5 peers, then `fetch_peers.py --tickers <T>,<P1>,<P2>,<P3>` → comparison table
4. Use WebSearch ONLY for qualitative items the scripts don't cover: latest earnings call commentary, news narrative around the latest quarter, breaking M&A, or sentiment.

**Data-quality habit — read before trusting the numbers:**
- `fetch_stock_snapshot.py` emits a `share_context` block: the share-count trend plus a `marketCap ≈ price × shares` check. If a price looks surprising (a name you remember near $900 prints at $136), read `share_context.note` BEFORE concluding the data is wrong — `marketcap_consistent: true` with a ratio near 1.0 means it's just split-adjusted, not corrupt. A ratio far from 1.0 flags a split/issuance/stale-series to verify.
- `pct_off_52w_high`/`low` use intraday highs/lows, so "0.0% off high" means literally at the high (not just the highest close).
- Peer rows include `revenue_growth` (latest annual YoY) alongside the multiples.

**Fallback: WebSearch (when no FMP key or for qualitative narrative).**

Primary data to fetch via WebSearch in fallback mode:
1. Current stock price and trading data (price, volume, 52-week range)
2. Financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow)
3. Key metrics (P/E, EPS, revenue, margins, debt ratios)
4. Analyst ratings and price targets
5. Recent news and developments
6. Peer/competitor data (for comparisons)
7. Technical data (moving averages, RSI, MACD when available)

Search strategy:
- Use ticker symbol + specific data needed (e.g., "AAPL financial metrics 2026")
- For comprehensive data: Search for earnings reports, investor presentations, or SEC filings
- For technical data: Be wary of stale moving averages — cross-check against current price
- Always verify data recency (prefer data from last quarter)

Quality sources: Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, MarketWatch, Seeking Alpha, Bloomberg, CNBC, SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q), TradingView/StockCharts.
